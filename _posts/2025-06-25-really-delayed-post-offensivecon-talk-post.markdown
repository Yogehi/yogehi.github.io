Oh look! Another really delayed post talk post!

In case you didn't know, I did a talk at OffensiveCon 25. It was about my Pwn2Own Ireland 2024 exploit against the Samsung Galaxy S24.

I didn't get any questions after the talk this time, and I like to think its because I explained everything that needed to be explained. Yay!

I don't know what else to put here...

But boy you should go watch the talk!
